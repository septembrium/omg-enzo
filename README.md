I use the following *great* projects here, which are not mine:

* Bottlepy
* PyQRNative

A payground for a bunch of related QR Code generator based applications.

This is as much a Git learning experience as it is a Python excercise,
so please don't take anything you find here seriously ;)

omg-enzo doesn't mean anything by the way
