qrcode generation
- generation library seems to break at higher than 10 characters, I probably need to adjust config based on input

templates
- generation
	- question

	- right / wrong

code structure
- implement junit tests, the generator seems to be prone to choking on certain data (mostly with numbers in them for content, filename, ...) 

back-end
- db plugin
- basics
- media queries for analytics  

server
- experiment with live setup
- determine if the adnega environment will suffice

features
- put constraints on the qrcode content (not too long, not empty, ...)
- ensure the alttag and titletag content is secure and doesn't break the HTML attribute (if applicable)
- track who's using the generator, even without having account and people logged in it would be interesting to see who keeps using the service based on a cookie or an identifier in their session
